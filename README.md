- Data Cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Feature Selection  
- Model Training & Evaluation  

## Models Used

- Linear Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- ⭐ Random Forest (Best Model)

## Final Result

Random Forest achieved the best performance with:

- R² Score: 0.88  
- Lower prediction error compared to other models  

## Key Insights
